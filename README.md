# Closed-Loop-Mechanisms
This repository contains the implementation of closed loop mechanisms as a 2nd semester project for a Mechanics course. The project likely involves the design and analysis of mechanical systems. The repository includes the codes for mechanisms and test the mechanisms, as well as documentation explaining the design and results of the project. The course likely covers the principles of kinematics, dynamics, and control in mechanical systems, and this project may serve as a hands-on application of those concepts.
